<b>UWP - Windows 10 GUI Live on Windows Store App </b></br>
Check The Youtube-dl GUI I've Created for Windows 10 (UWP) Unfortunately the App is not working on Windows Mode S, "In Windows S mode, only Microsoft-signed code can run (OS binaries & apps from the Microsoft Store), so you can’t just CreateProcess/Process.Start an EXE that you’ve downloaded from a share or website. That will fail in S mode, but its working on others version and its Live on Windows Apps Store.</br>

Any suggestions are welcome</br>
